# Chapter 1: Registration & Sign In

Before a user can interact with your product device and the connected features of the mobile application, they must first authenticate by creating an account or connecting with their Facebook account.

The Home Automation Micro-Vertical includes a number of screens for signing in, creating an account, welcome email and landing page templates, and resetting an account password.

## **Splash**

For a short period of time as the app starts up and before its initialized and ready for the user, a static splash screen will display.

Your applicationâ€™s splash screen should consist of a company logo and/or branded graphics.
